# The Transition
In reality, all you need to know in terms of transition is inside the [RadiusTransition](https://github.com/alexstyl/RadiusTransition/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/alexstyl/radiustransition/transition/RadiusTransition.kt) class. This repo shows you how to use it and how to combine it with multiple transitions such as the ChangeShape and ArcMotion for a nicer effect.
